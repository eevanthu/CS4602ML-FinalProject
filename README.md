CS4602ML-FinalProject: TSMC (2330) Stock Movement Prediction📈 Stacking Ensemble Architecture for Financial ForecastingThis project implements a robust machine learning pipeline to predict the price movement (Up/Down) of TSMC (2330). By leveraging a multi-model Stacking Ensemble approach, we combine the strengths of distance-based algorithms, tree-based models, and deep learning architectures to capture complex market dynamics.🚪 Quick Navigation (傳送門)ResourceDescriptionLink🌐 Website GalleryCurated financial data sources & research sites🔗 View Sites📁 Data RepositoryRaw and processed datasets for 2330 forecasting🔗 Explore Data📍 CheckPointsProject milestones and phase-wise reports🔗 CheckPoints📊 Result HubExported prediction probabilities (Meta-features)🔗 View Results🗂️ Project StructureThe repository is organized into four core functional domains:Plaintext.

🚀 Key Technical Features1. Multi-dimensional Feature EngineeringWe integrate 100+ technical indicators, macro-market data, and interdependency signals:Technical: MA, RSI, MACD, K/D, Bollinger Bands.Global Macro: S&P 500, NASDAQ, SOX (Philly Semiconductor), DJI.Cross-Market: TSMC ADR price movements and VIX volatility.2. Advanced Preprocessing PipelineTemporal Alignment: Corrects for U.S./Taiwan market time differences (Shift-1) to ensure Zero Data Leakage.Cluster Augmentation: Using K-Means to identify market regimes, providing the KNN model with logical environment anchors.Smart Imputation: Categorical handling of missing values (Binary vs. Continuous) to maintain time-series integrity.3. Stacking Ensemble MechanismBase Learners: A diverse "Zoo" of models trained to capture different market anomalies.Rolling Forecast: Models are trained annually (2020–2024) to generate out-of-sample predictions.Meta-Learner: The final Stacking layer learns how to dynamically weight each model's probability output based on historical accuracy.🛠️ Getting StartedInstallationEach module is designed with self-contained dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:Bash# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/CS4602ML-FinalProject.git

# 2. Setup environment for a specific module (e.g., KNN)
cd code/models/KNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
Execution OrderPreprocessing: Run code/preprocess/preprocess.ipynb to build the feature matrix.Base Training: Execute notebooks in code/models/ to populate the results/ folder.Ensemble: Run code/stack/stacking.ipynb to fuse base model predictions.Evaluation: Use code/backtest/backtest6.py to generate the final investment report.📈 Performance SummaryResults are updated per milestone in the CheckPoint folder.Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only.
